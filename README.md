# Image Filters
In this repo are stored some filters for images implemented in processing.\
Each folder contains one or more filters with a brief explanation on how it works. <
The only prerequisite for running these files is (Processing 4.3)[https://processing.org/]\
Test images are provided for the filters but is possible to use one's own images by simply drag and dropping them into the interface and appropriately modifying the **img_n** variable.
